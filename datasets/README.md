Folder `training` contains all data required to *fine-tune* *BERT* model:

 `train.csv`, `val.csv`, `test.csv` are respectively  datasets for model to train, validate and test.

`scored_sequence.csv` - aptamer sequences with their *Entropy* calculated in *EFBA*.

Folder `ga_interim_data` to seperate every genetic algorithm and be able to follow process progress within every iteration.

Folder `model_validation` has results for every trained NN model from which we can calculate fitness of model.
